VR Museum:
In this museum, you can find an assortment of foods from all over the globe. At each exhibit, the information that is displayed will tell you the name, country of origin, ingredients, and who is attributed to the creation of said food. Each exhibit features fixed lighting to highlight and accentuate the unique characteristics of each food. Using the teleportation points, you will be able to easily jump from exhibit to exhibit with no hassle, displaying the information at the point when hopped to it with collision hitboxes.
